Introduction:
In this project, we tried to provide as much info as possible for all the national parks around the united states. The program only takes the state and the month that you are planning to travel, and it will give you information such as the description of the parks, the weather condition, complete address, the location of the parks on the map, and the full address of each park in a specific state. 
This app's main structure is python, and we used HTML, CSS for ease of use, and a better user interface.

Requirements: 
In order to run the program, you first need to install flask
$ pip install Flask
and then run flask
$ flask run

Run the port that has been given to you in a browser, and you can use the app.

UI: 
The main page displays a line with two questions that the user can use the dropdowns to answer to the questions. 
Below the questions, there is an extensive map that displays the entire map of the united states.
When you answer the questions and click on search, the app will display all the national parks on the map with small marks on each park's location. 
You can get more details of each park by clicking on the marks shown on the map.
